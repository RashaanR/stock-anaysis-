## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Steve analysize the certian stock tickers through out the years using vba tools in excel. For a varity of tickers
we found the daily volume and their yearly return. 
## Results
As a result of our research we developed an arrary of tickers and found the total daily volume and return for each of them during the years of 2017 and 2018.
2017 what of been a great year to invest your money in the market due to 11 out of 12 tickers yielding a positive ruturn in addition to 4 out of the 11 having 
over a 100% net return.

The year 2018 was almost the complete opposite of 2017. Not only was volume down by 100 million but, only 2 out of the 12 tickers had a positive net return.

## Summary
Overall this assignmemt was pretty sufficient in teaching vba script and how to refactor it. The only issue I had was with the time frames for running the reports. I believe i ran them so much that they started to say it took 0 seconds to run. Before each report would take a couple seconds at least.

A key advantage in refactoring vba script is that it can introduce you to new methods on how to code certian elements. On the down side refactoring a code can bring in bugs that arent wanted. For example, when I kept getting errors when refactoring the code for the output of arrays on the "all stocks analysis" sheet. It took me hours to debug it, but in the process I learned how to use breaking pointsand how to use the "For i" function.
